								</p><h2><strong>Early Years</strong></h2></p>

								<p>
								I grew up in a small district of Qiqihar, a city in Northeast China. My childhood was peaceful 
								and full of happiness - not rich in material things, but rich in warmth and simple joy. After 
								finishing primary school, I moved to downtown Qiqihar to attend a better middle school and high 
								school. I graduated from Qiqihar Experimental High School in 2019.

								<p><strong>University Life</strong></p>

								<p>
								Coming from a small district, choosing to study in Shanghai was both a big step and a long-held 
								wish of mine. From 2019 to 2023, I studied Mechatronics at Tongji University. During those four 
								years, I made close friends, saw a wider world, and learned a great deal. I worked hard and 
								received several awards, including the National Scholarship. In my final year of undergraduate 
								study, I went to Germany as an exchange student at Ernst-Abbe-Hochschule Jena and obtained a 
								double degree.

								After graduating, I continued my studies at the Technical University of Munich, majoring in 
								Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence. Studying abroad greatly broadened my perspective, and I 
								have met many inspiring and talented people along the way.

								<p>
								When I was a child, I was encouraged to study hard and get good grades - and that has shaped 
								much of my life. However, I gradually realized that academic performance alone is not enough. 
								To accomplish meaningful work in engineering, practical experience is essential. That is one 
								of the reasons I created this page - to document what I've learned along the way.
								</p>
								
								<p>
								Since August 2023, I have been working at ChenYang Technologies as a part-time research intern, 
								focusing on developing embedded hardware and software to improve the measurement accuracy of 
								Hall-effect current sensors for small measuring ranges. Through this experience, I gained 
								knowledge in circuit design, prototyping, embedded programming, and signal processing.
								</p>

								<p>
								During my Master's studies, I also completed two major course projects. The first involved 
								improving a human motion generation model, where we replaced text-based input with image-based 
								input. The second project involved controlling a 7-DOF Franka robotic arm using a remote haptic 
								device. In that project, I learned about Cartesian impedance control, force feedback, as well as 
								Gaussian Mixture Models and Gaussian Mixture Regression.
								</p>

								<p>
								Recently, I have also started practicing LeetCode problems to improve my programming and 
								problem-solving skills - not necessarily for building large projects or doing researches, 
								but to strengthen my fundamentals and stay sharp, as I don't have a strong computer science
								background. It is fascinating to see how elegant algorithms and well-designed data structures 
								can solve complex problems efficiently.
